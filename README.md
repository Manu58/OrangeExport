# OrangeExport
This is a fast solution to provide  exporting from [OrangeHRM, version 3.3.2](http://www.orangehrm.com/), but is also usable for earlier versions (>3).
For all reports  4 buttons appear for export to Excel (.xlsx), CSV-file, pdf and to the browsers print facility.

The plugin is based on [DataTables.js](https://www.datatables.net/), a jQuery plugin. Only two configuration files from Orange needed some change. 
I hope it is usefull

#How to install: copy the files with path into the root of OrangeHRM, normally no need to restart the server
